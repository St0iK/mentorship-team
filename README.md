# Node.js Mentorship Program

Hi, NodeJS Mentorship Team,

I am Dimitris, a Software Developer from Greece living in the UK. I use Node.js daily and it would be an honour for me to get involved and give back to the community as well as to support its growth and development in any way that I can. I am very passionate about learning/growing and I always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Being accepted in the Mentorship Team will be a great opportunity for me to meet new people and learn/work and collaborate with some of the most experienced mentors and engineers.

I have experience with both being a mentor as well as a mentee and I believe I have strong verbal and written communication skills that I can bring into the Mentorship Team, being a good listener, and use empathy to build relationships with humility, trust and respect.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
